A chocolate repository

If you love chocolate, you've come to the right place! I am a chocolate expert. 

How does one become a chocolate expert? I have over a decade of experience tasting single-origin dark chocolate made with fine flavor cacao.
I educate consumers about chocolate made by craft chocolate makers that celebrates the unique flavor profiles of cacao grown in different regions.
We share chocolate together in a guided chocolate tasting while considering flavor, texture, mouthfeel and aftertaste.
We learn about the elements required from both the cacao farmer and the chocolate maker to turn well-fermented cacao beans into a tasty bar of chocolate.
